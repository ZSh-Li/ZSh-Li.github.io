[A Modular Direct Description Method With Low Memory Usage and Execution Time for Hysteresis Modeling and Compensation of Piezoelectric Actuators](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10495749)

<strong><font color="#44679E">Content</font></strong>
- The presented modular direct description (MDD) method can accurately describe and compensate hysteresis phenomenon. 
- The MDD-based model offers the advantage of small memory consumption, making it suitable for application in memory-constrained scenarios.
- The execution time of this model is short and stable, which can be applied in applications requiring a high computational period.
- The MDD method has the potential to become a general modeling method for solving hysteresis challenges.

[An Automated Pick-and-Place Method for Irregular-Shaped Microspheres Inspired by Chopstick Operation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10744564)

**Zengsheng Li**, Dunfa Long, Shaoan Chen, Chaoyang Shi

<strong><font color="#44679E">Content</font></strong>
- This paper proposes an automated irregular-shaped microbead assembly method that includes a lifting pickup strategy and an adhesion-vibration release strategy. 
- The developed method exhibits a high pickup success rate and
high accuracy release of irregular microbeads validated through pick-and-place experiments and eventually applies to both 2D and 3D assemblies.
- This work is highly applicable and convenient due to the absence of the need for special treatment of operating instruments and environment, making it a promising candidate for large-scale production applications.
